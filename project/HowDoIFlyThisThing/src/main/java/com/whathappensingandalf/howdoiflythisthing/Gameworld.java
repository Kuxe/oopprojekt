 *	Gameworld is responsible for doing computations within the gameworld.
 *	Gameworld has and maintains a list of interfaces which game world objects (eg. spaceship) implements
 *	These interfaces should provide methods for accesing data required for logic.
 *	The logic is calculated in this class; all spaceships and asteroids, and so forth, rely on the same piece of code which
 *	moves an object.
 *
 * 	This is somewhat similar to Entity-component-system design. The purpose is to eliminate duplicate code, for example
 *  moving an asteroid and moving a spaceship is exactly the same piece of code - instead of duplicating the code.
